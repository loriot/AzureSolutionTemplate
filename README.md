To run locally, ensure you have the latest Azure CLI installed from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).
Run with the following command:

```powershell
az group deployment create --name ExampleDeployment --resource-group YourResourceGroup --template-file azuredeploy.json --parameters azuredeploy.parameters.json
```

>NOTE: Once deployed, you will need to navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and start the Stream Analytics job manually using the button at the top of the blade. For instructions on how to do this if you have chosen to deploy the Power BI component of the template, please see the [power-bi](power-bi/) folder readme.

## Device Twins

When adding new devices to the IoT Hub, ensure you modify the Device Twin to include the following tags in order for the routing function to assign the correct decoder:

## Power BI

This deployment also provides (optional) Power BI visualisation functionality as a starting point for data analysis (both realtime and historical). For instructions on how to make use of this capability please look in the [power-bi](power-bi/) folder.

## Device Emulation

Provided with this project is a script that can be used to generate device messages to test the pipeline in the absence of a real device. For more information, see the [test](test/) folder.

## Environment variables

### LORIOT_APP_ID

The LORIOT App Id used to identify under which app the devices are synced.

```

```

### EVENT_HUB_ROUTER_OUTPUT

Connection string defining the output of the router function to the enriched and decoded message Event Hub.

User ID=username;Password=password;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;
```

### DEVICE_LIFECYCLE_CONNECTION_STRING

### DEVICE_LIFECYCLE_QUEUE_NAME

### DEVICE_LIFECYCLE_IMPORT_TIMER

## Router function

The router function is triggered by messages coming from the Iot Hub (connection defined in the EVENTHUB_ROUTER_INPUT environment variable) and route them to the appropriate decoder.
Routing is done based on a *sensordecoder* property present in the device twins tags in the IoT Hubs (connection defined in the IOT_HUB_OWNER_CONNECTION_STRING environment variable).  The function can access this information using the *iothub-connection-device-id* message propertyautomatically added by the IoT Hub. 
In a nutshell, routing will  follow the following strategy: 

* if an environment variable with name "DECODER_URL_*sensordecoder*" or "DECODER_URL_DEFAULT_*sensordecoder*" exists, the message will be routed defined there.
* if those environment variables are not present in the web app. The message will be automatically routed to a function named after the *sensordecoder* located on the same function app. The route will be https://{nameOfCurrentFunctionApp}.azurewebsites.net/api/{*sensordecoder*}.

The output of the function will be directed in an eventhub (connection defined by EVENT_ROUTER_OUTPUT environment variable). Output messages are composed by the following subsection:

* MessageGuid: a unique GUID generated by the Router function to track each single message.
* Raw: an exact carbon copy of the raw message received from the IoT Hub.
* Metadata: Device twins tags present in the IoT Hub.
* Decoded: Decoded message from the IoT device decoded by the appropriate decoder.

## Setup function

Setup function is aimed at setting up the CosmosDb collection and and the SQL table needed by the general architecture. The function will be triggered at the end of the execution of the ARM template automatically. The function use environment variables DOCUMENT_DB_NAME, DOCUMENT_DB_ACCESS_KEY and SQL_DB_CONNECTION to be able to connect to the two ressources. 
In case the collection or tables already exist, the function return without doing nothing.
